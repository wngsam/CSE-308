       If you received confirmation at the end of your transaction that your purchase was successful you should have a copy of your confirmation email.  Please be aware that because the confirmation email comes from a no reply email address it can often be redirected to your SPAM folder.
        If you have checked your SPAM folder and you still cannot find your confirmation email you can view and print a copy directly from your Fandango VIP account! 
        You can also view the purchase you made as a Guest by creating a Fandango VIP account. The link below will open a new window where you can sign into or create your Fandango VIP account:
        Once you have signed in to your Fandango VIP account, place your mouse over 'My VIP Account' in the upper right corner of the home page and click on it. Your most recent purchase and a list of all you movie ticket purchases will be found in your 'Purchase History'. For details on how to get your tickets at the theater click the ‘View Order Details’ link.

        Pick up instructions will vary depending on the theater and how you paid for your tickets. Check your confirmation email or purchase history under My VIP Account to find your specific instructions.
Generally, ticket redemption usually falls in one of two categories:
1. Credit/Debit Card - If you used a credit or debit card you will need to bring the card you used to purchase the tickets in order to pick them up. Depending on the theater, you can go to a kiosk, guest services or the box office for ticket pick up.
2. Promo Codes - If you purchased using promo codes you will need your confirmation number to pick up your tickets. You can find the confirmation number on your confirmation email or in your purchase history under My Account. Depending on the theater, you can go to a kiosk, guest services or the box office for ticket pick up.
If you purchased tickets for a show at a Mobile Ticket enabled theater, then no pick up is necessary. You can take the mobile device that you purchased the tickets on (also available in your purchase history under My Account) directly to the ticket-taker and show them your Mobile Ticket for admission to the show. No waiting in line is necessary! Remember, only one Mobile Ticket is issued for each transaction regardless of the number of tickets purchased, so all parties must be present when the mobile device is shown to the ticket-taker.
If you purchased from a Print at Home enabled theater, you can print your tickets at home from your computer and take your bar-coded ticket directly to the ticket-taker for scanning.

7. Carefully review the details of your order on the 'Review' page before clicking on 'Complete My Purchase'.
8. Instructions for picking up your tickets vary by theater. Please review the instructions on your order confirmation page carefully for specific details.

        Select theaters on Fandango will allow you to Reserve your seat in advance. Look for 'Reserved Seating' next to show times to find theaters that are offering this feature. Reserved Seating takes the guaranteed seat that Fandango promises on all orders a step further and lets you pick your exact seat(s). At the end of your purchase process for a reserved seat on Fandango, you will be provided with a specific seat number on your confirmation page that will be waiting for you when you get to the theater.
        Please note that this feature does not always allow you to choose a specific seat. Some reserved seating theaters assign a seat in a special Reserved Seating auditorium that promises an excellent view for your show.
